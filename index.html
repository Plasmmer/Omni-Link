<h1>Principles</h1>
<h2>Omni-Presence</h2>
<p>Same post/issue/content, linked in any network with JSON's "omni" array.</p>
<p>Sites/content/social networks that doesn't natively supports omni-link, can also link: for example, posting omni-links as a comment on your Instagram photo, which also links to same DeviantArt one.</p>
<p>Namecoin is already a begin of Omni-Link: a .bit domain can link to multiple sources (www, zeronet, ipfs, dat, ssb). Same for Emercoin and ENS (Ethereum Name Service).</p>
<p>IPFS' <a href="https://ipld.io/" target="blank">IPLD</a> is also a omnipresence-compliant, as it stores all different hash types of the same file.</p>
<h2>Omni-Adapt</h2>
<p>Pages are rendered differently depending on platform (thanks to FrameworkJS).
Instead of common elements, the ones you want to display only case on a specific platform (WWW, Dat, IPFS) you put into platform-specific tags.</p>
<p>It also enables to point different links depending on platform (on IPFS, point only to specific social networks).</p>
<p>A lot of use-cases can be applyed; it is platform-related localization of content and its links.</p>
<h2>Omni-Recite</h2>
<p>Instead of duplicating the same text on same network (Omni-Link's purpose is to duplicate content only on different platforms), it gets text from sources.</p>
<p>With the Recite principle, you can get text in a Markdown doc or HTML site directly from a JSON file.</p>

<h1>To implement in:</h1>
<ul>
<li>Plugzlr (work-in-progress)</li>
<li>FrameworkJS</li>
<li>Hugo and all site pages</li>
<li>Omni-Recite in Hugo profile page (includes photo URLs with Omni-Presence)</li>
</ul>

<h1>Contributing</h1>

<hr><small>
    <p>To do:</p>
    <ul>
<li>"omni" external scheme for Dat's Unwalled Garden spec</li>
<li>Depends upon FrameworkJS modularization/components and its platform-aware rendering</li>
<li>Support QRL</li>
<li>bridges: deviantart+instagram+downloadedarchive+datphotoalbum</li>
<li>bridges: any post in peepeth is considered peepeth when "via" is empty or begins with "peepeth", read other "via" values / peepeth profiles stored in OrbitDB</li>
<li>browser extension for URL fallback (show if URL is available on other networks, rechognize fallback option in URL)</li>
</ul>
