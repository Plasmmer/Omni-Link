# Omni-Link

![Draft](https://img.shields.io/badge/Draft-In%20progress-yellow.svg) ![Not implemented](https://img.shields.io/badge/Status-Not%20implemented-red.svg)

The spec that the Web 3.0 is needing.
Same content, linked in any place, also integrated with Plugzle.

# Principles

- Main registry in QRL
- Same post/issue/content, linked in any network with JSON's "omni" array
- Pages are rendered diferently depending on platform (FrameworkJS), and also shows different links (platform-related localization of content and its links)

## Contributing

This is a open-source and accessible spec, so you're welcome to open a issue (with criticism/suggestions) and open pull requests with improvements.
Please follow our <a href="http://www.contributor-covenant.org/" target="_blank">Code of Conduct</a> before interacting or contributing.

## Todo

- Registry in QRL
- "omni" external scheme for Dat's Unwalled Garden spec
- Depends on FrameworkJS modularization/components and its platform-aware rendering
